# sociodbbatch
A Springboot Batch Application which Updates Registered Socios and their Bank Accounts

1) General Info About the Socio-Micro-Service-Demo

2) Specific Info Concerning Each Single Application


## General Info ====

The Socio Micro Services Project will consist of about 10 small (backend) Springboot applications, deployed in a Docker Container/ Linux Oracle Virtual Box. SocioRegister is the principal part of a series of four applications called: starter, mock, jpa, socioregister. Together they show a stepwise buildup to a Springboot REST application, which contains use-cases for registering and adding Socios (similar to Facebook). This line of applications goes from an almost empty Springboot shell (starter: one controller method only) to a small but full-fledged REST application: SocioRegister which will be used as a component of our micro-services.

Next you`ll find four other serving applications. The simple SocioWeather, provides a weather-report by city by consulting an external REST-service called Open Weather. SocioBank, permits money transaction between Socios, also consulting an external service for exchange rates. The SocioSecurity, a Cookie/ Token based SpringSecurity (OAUTH2), still has to be written. Finally the SocioDbBatch application is interesting because it will update, on a daily bases, the databases of SocioRegister (socio_db) and SocioBank (soicio_bank_db). The DBs run on MySQL or Postgres.

From SocioRegister-jpa one finds backend-Validation (javax) and REST-Exception Handeling of Spring (RestControllerAdvice).

Testing, in general, will have an important focus and since we are dealing with Spring(boot) there will systematically testing based on five mayor strategies:

	-@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)

	-@ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class) standalone setup (two ways)

	-@ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class) server tests (@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)

	-@DataJpaTest wich is database testing on H2

	-Spring Batch testing

Testing is still "work in progress"



## Specific Info SocioDbBatch ====

The second SpringBatch sociodbbatch runs on a schedular (see ScheduledTasks class at com.artsgard.sociodbbatch) and updates several DB tables each 24 hours. The Batch runs on three seperated DBs 

  1) Batch Meta-Data db socio_batch_meta_data_db
  
  2) The SocioRegister db socio_db
  
  3) The SocioBank db socio_bank_db

For the moment they are all Postgres, but soon I will implement a different vendor for each (MySQL batch meta-data, Postrgres SocioRegister, Oracle-thin SocioBank).

### What are Batches in General

A Batch (Spring-Batch) can be pretty complicated, but its concept is rather simple: Process (big) data on the basis of a single line/ record. The number of records processed in memory is called a chunck (similar to paginate of a JPA or REST-service). The core-part of this process is the step which consits of a reader-processor-writer. A step can also be a tasklet (see the batch part of SocioBank: com.artsgard.sociobank.tasklet DeleteTablesTasklet) which does on single thing, like e.g. clearing a db-table. At com.artsgard.sociodbbatch.config BatchFlowConfig you may observe a step process of three steps each opdating a different table 1) SocioRegister db SocioModel 2) SocioAssociatedSocio (with chunks of 20 records/ lines each). The third step will update the Account table of the SocioBank db:

	@Bean
	public Step socioStep() throws Exception {
		return stepBuilders.get("batchdbsocioStep-socio")
			.<SocioModel, SocioModel>chunk(20)
			.reader(socioReader)
			.processor(socioProcessor)
			.writer(socioWriter)
			.transactionManager(socioTransactionManager)
			.build();
	}
	
	@Bean
	public Step associatedSocioStep() throws Exception {
		return stepBuilders.get("batchdbsocioStep-associated")
			.<SocioAssociatedSocio, SocioAssociatedSocio>chunk(20)
			.reader(associatedReader)
			.processor(associatedProcessor)
			.writer(associatedWriter)
			.transactionManager(socioTransactionManager)
			.build();
    	}
	
	@Bean
	public Step accountStep() throws Exception {
		return stepBuilders.get("batchdbsocioStep-account")
			.<SocioModel, Account>chunk(20)
			.reader(socioReader)
			.processor(socioAccountProcessor)
			.writer(accountWriter)
			.transactionManager(bankTransactionManager)
			.build();
	}

### What does SocioDbBatch do

	1) When a new socio registers the Batch will note that fact (register date) and when the schedular runs the Batch (every 24 hours at 10.10) the batch will open a account for this new socio and donated a bonus of 20EUR (nice hÃ¨) -> the third step of the flow;
	
	2) When a socio invites another socio (associated-socio) the field AssociatedSocioState will be changed to PENDING. The invited associated-socio has one month to respond (ACCEPTED/ DENIED). After one month has passed the Batch will change the field into EXPIRED;
	
	3) In case a socio has not logged into his/ her account for more than a month the boolean flag active will be set to false (this will only work when the Token-Spring-Security has been implemented)

That is about all concerning the Batch. I will start soon to implement the security part but first I will do all the Docker images and implement a simple Spring-Cloud config server.

Still pending Batch-testing!
